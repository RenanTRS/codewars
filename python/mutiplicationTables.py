#Create a function that accepts dimensions, of Rows x Columns, as parameters in order to create a multiplication table sized 
#according to the given dimensions. **The return value of the function must be an array, and the numbers must be Fixnums, NOT 
#strings.Each value on the table should be equal to the value of multiplying the number in its first row times the number in its 
#first column.
